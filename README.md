# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Exercises
Here is my progress on the exercises as I work through the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", beginning 10/25/2017

The better PDF copy of the book can be found here: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/6515.pdf

I'm using mostly the `stk-simply` and `mit-scheme` programs.
`stk-simply` is used in Brian Harvey's 61A lectures which I'm loosely following: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhMnuBfGeCDNgVzLPxF9o5UNKG1b-LFY9

`mit-scheme` was necessary to be able to use a `(runtime)` function.
