;; Q: Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can be formulated as
;; an accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial

; a[n]x^n + a[n-1]x^n-1 + ... + a[1]x + a[0]

;; using a well-known algorithm called Horner's rule, which structures the
;; computation as

; (...(a[n]x + a[n-1])x + ... + a[1])x + a[0]

;; In other words, we start with a[n], multiply by x, add a[n-1], multiply by
;; x, and so on, until we reach a[0]. Fill in the following template to produce
;; a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using Horner's rule. Assume that the
;; coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from a[0] through
;; a[n].

; (define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
;   (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms) <??>)
;               0
;               coefficient-sequence))

;; For example, to compute 1 + 3x + 5x^3 + x^5 at x = 2 you would evaluate

; (horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))

;; A:

(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms)
                (+ this-coeff (* x higher-terms)))
              0
              coefficient-sequence))
