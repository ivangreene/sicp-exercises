;; Q: Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances there is a
;; simple formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of
;; two intervals in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify
;; the problem by assuming that all numbers are positive.

;; A: The percentage tolerance of a product of two intervals will be
;; approximately the sum of the percentage tolerances of the factors.
